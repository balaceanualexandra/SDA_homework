Create class Dog.
- Add private fields to the class, like name, age, gender, race, weight.
- Create constructor that accepts all of the class fields.
- Create additional constructor, that will accept only gender and race. It should call main constructor with default values.
- Create getters and setters for age and weight.
- Create object of class Dog. Verify if everything works as expected.
- Add verification for all arguments passed to the setters. E.g. setWeight method should not accept values below or equal to 0.
