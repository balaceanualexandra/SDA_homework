    // 1. Write a Java program to sum values of an array: [1, 7, 3, 10, 9]
    //  Output: 30


    //2. Write a Java program to calculate the average value of array elements: [1, 7, 3, 10, 9]
    //  Output: 6


    //3. Write a Java program to print all odd numbers from an array: [1, 7, 3, 10, 9]
    //  Output: 1, 7, 3, 9


    //4. Write a Java program to find the maximum and minimum value of an array: [1, 7, 3, 10, 9]
    //  Output: Min=1; Max=10


    //5. Write a Java program to reverse an array of integer values: [1, 7, 3, 10, 9]
    //  Output: [9, 10, 3, 7, 1]


    //6. Write a Java program to find the number of even and odd integers in a given array of integers:
    //  [1, 7, 3, 10, 9]
    //  Output: Odd=4; Even=1


    //7. Write a Java program to insert an element at a specific position into an array: [1, 7, 3, 10, 9];
    //insert 4 at position 2; remember that an array starts from 0
    //  Output: [1, 7, 4, 3, 10, 9]


    //8. Write a Java program to find the duplicate values of an array of integers: [1, 7, 3, 7, 10, 1, 9]
    //  Output: 1 & 7


    //9. Write a Java program to find the second largest element in an array: [1, 7, 3, 10, 9]
    //  Output: 9


    //10. Write a Java program to find all pairs of elements in an array whose sum is equal to a specified
    //number: [1, 2, 7, 3, 10, 2, 9] with sum 4
    //  Output: 1-3; 2-2
