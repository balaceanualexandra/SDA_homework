- Create a Animal class with fields: name, age, weight, race. Don't apply encapsulation yet.
- Add operations to add bedrooms, squaremeters, bathrooms, floors.
- Add a parameterized Constructor that validates the inputs ( all fields > 0)
- Apply encapsulation. Generate getters / setters
- Decide if the add operations are still required. Maybe you can delete them and use setters instead
- Add a method that returns the price/square meter
- Generate the toString method
- Create 5 different houses and print their details.  Maybe use a loop / foreach.
- Optional:
  - Create a RealEstateAgent class with only a method: public House findCheapestHouse(List<House> houses) that finds the cheapeast house in the list and returns it.
